\section{Problem Statement}

In the Gambler's Ruin Problem, we have a gambler $A$ and a casino $B$, who are playing a game against each other. The total combined fortune of the two is $k$ dollars, with the gambler starting with $i$ dollars, and the casino starting with $k-i$ dollars, where $i$ and $k-i$ are known positive integers. On each play of the game, the probability that $A$ will win one dollar from $B$ is $p$, where $0<p<1$, and the probability that $B$ will win one dollar from $A$ is $1-p$.

Suppose that the game is played repeatedly (and independently) until the fortune of either $A$ or $B$ is reduced to 0 dollars.



\section{Problem Solution}
Let $a_i$ denote the probability that gambler $A$ will reach $k$ dollars before it reaches 0 dollars, given that their initial fortune is $i$ dollars. Since each play of the game is independent of the others, we can think of the problem essentially starts over on each play, with the only difference being that the ``initial'' fortunes of the gambler and casino have changed. The value of interest is $a_i$ for $i\in\{0,1,\ldots,k-1,k\}$.

\subsection{Solution for $i \in \{0,k\}$}

The cases of $i=0$ and $i=k$ are trivial. When $A$ runs out of money they can no longer play, and thus $a_0=0$, and when $A$ wins all $k$ dollars, the casino can no longer play, and thus $a_k=1$. Finding $a_i$ when $i\not\in\{0,k\}$ is nontrivial and is solved below.

\subsection{Solution for $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,k-2,k-1\}$}

Define the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A_1$ is the event in which the gambler wins one dollar (i.e., the casino loses one dollar) on the first play of the game,
\item $B_1$ is the event in which the casino wins one dollar (i.e., the gambler loses one dollar) on the first play of the game, and
\item $W$ is the event in which the gambler wins all $k$ dollars before reaching $0$ dollars.
\end{itemize}

By the Law of Total Probability, we see that
\begin{eqnarray}
\Prob(W)&=\Prob(A_1)\Prob(W|A_1)+\Prob(B_1)\Prob(W|B_1) \nonumber 
\\
&=p\Prob(W|A_1)+(1-p)\Prob(W|B_1). \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
